# Two-Factor Authentication
Security experts generally recognize three categories of authentication: something you know; a password or passcode, something you have; a physical device of some kind, and something you are; fingerprint, iris scan, or voice imprint. Multi-factor authentication is any system of authentication that uses two or more of these categories to verify who you are. Authentication systems that utilize multiple factors are becoming more popular and are inherently more secure than those that only require a password. In particular, you should look to protect email and bank accounts.

The most common mechanisms for providing a second factor for authentication are SMS text message to a mobile phone number and a time based one-time password algorithm using a smartphone app. It should be noted that SMS based factors are no longer recommended by [NIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology) because of relative insecurity so we recommend time based one-time passwords using a smart phone app where available.

In the case of Google, an additional multi-factor option is availbe in the form of push notifications to android phones or the Google app on iOS. This is considered an even more secure option and is recommended for your Google account.
