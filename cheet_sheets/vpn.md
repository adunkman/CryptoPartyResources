# Private Internet/VPN - OpenVPN, Tiny Hardware Firewall, ProXPN
VPN is short for Virtual Private Network. A VPN offers point-to-point encryption of all sorts of Internet traffic. It allows you to hide your browsing from anyone peeping around near by. You may be most familiar with using a VPN to connect securely to a work network.

## Scenarios
### Private Browsing From Public Networks
An unsecured public network at a hotel or coffee shop is just that, insecure. Connecting to a VPN service or a VPN server at home will hide what youâ€™re doing from anyone in the area.

### Hiding your IP Address and Activity While at Home
You can connect to a VPN service hosted out of your area, even in a different country, to hide your Internet activity from local snooping. This obscures your IP address, making it more difficult to track you, and prevents anyone from tapping your activity at the local ISP.

## Solutions
### OpenVPN - https://openvpn.net/
OpenVPN is an open source VPN solution you can host yourself. Some routers and NAS devices can run an OpenVPN service for you. PiVPN is a easy solution using a Raspberry Pi. You could also run an OpenVPN server on AWS or GCP.

### Tiny Hardware Firewall - http://www.tinyhardwarefirewall.com/
This device will connect to a WiFi or hardwire network and act as a filter for malicious actors on the local network. It can be configured to connect to a VPN automatically, simplifying set up.

### ProXPN - https://secure.proxpn.com/
There are many VPN services out there. ProXPN is included here since they have a free tier that works for both Windows and MacOS and their privacy policy explicitly states that they do not keep any record of connection activity. Buying up to the premium subscription allows you access on iOS and Android devices, but other paid options are available too.
