# Private Group Chat - Semaphor
End-to-end encrypted group chat system similar to Slack or HipChat. Not as fully featured as those more mainstream offerings, but it uses strong encryption and SpiderOak has no way to decrypt any of your information on their servers. Supports both mobile and desktop clients. Freemium model means you can use it for free with some restrictions. The Semaphor clients are open source.
