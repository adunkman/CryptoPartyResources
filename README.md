# CyberSecurity and Privacy Event Resources

Inspired by CryptoParty.in, we've hosted a few beginner cybersecurity and privacy workshops. While there are many great resources for information on such things available all over the Internet, they are rarely organized into easily consumable, workshoppable nuggets. To that end, we've created this set of resources for anyone who would like to run such an event but would rather not put together their own material.

> *General Disclaimer: 100% security is not possible. Everything we do here is in an effort to move the goal post, to make it harder and less profitable for someone to get your private information.*

## How We Evaluate Tools

While we do recommend the usage of certain tools, apps, and services over others here, we are in no way affiliated with those we've recommended. We do not benefit when you download or sign up for these services. There are a number of guidelines we try to follow and attributes we look for to aid us in making these recommendations.

### End-to-End Encryption

Systems which use encryption schemes where only the communicating users can read the messages are prefered to those where the service provider has the ability to decrypt your information. If only you and the person you are communicating with have the ability to read your messages, the system is considered far more secure.

### Free or Open Source Software

Systems which are built on Free and Open Source software are preferred to those which are proprietary. Open source software is open for inspection generally by security experts. Though we do recognize that simply because something is open source doesn’t mean that it has been audited by experts. Generally speaking, though, we find we can more easily trust that which is reviewable over that which is completely out of sight.

### Federated Systems

Systems which are not owned or controlled by a single entity are prefered over those owned or controlled by a single company. For instance, email is a system where anyone can participate as a provider whereas FaceBook chat is 100% controlled by FaceBook. We present plenty of corporate controlled solutions here, but we consider this a good general rule.

### Convenience vs Security

Systems which strike a good balance between convenience and security. Convenience is forever at odds with security. When making systems more secure, it almost always comes at the cost of convenience. We make these trade offs because it’s the right thing to do. However, many modern solutions try to build in novel user experience to make up for the loss of convenience. We present solutions here that we feel present a fair balance between these poles. We’re happy to share more secure alternatives, if you’re looking to explore the deep end.
